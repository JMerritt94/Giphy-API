# Giphy-API

This app was our first assignment that had to use APIs. Users can choose from the preset buttons for searches or enter in a new animal to look up gifs for.
I used the Giphy API to populate the screen with gifs of what the user searches. This demonstrates my ability to make dynamic websites
that you can update with jquery and APIs. The front end was made with Bootstrap.
